# IoT-Based Smart Ambulance System

## Overview
The IoT-Based Smart Ambulance System is designed to revolutionize emergency medical services by integrating advanced technologies such as ECG and temperature sensors for real-time patient monitoring. The system uses cloud technology for faster health data retrieval and GPS for real-time patient tracking, significantly improving the efficiency and effectiveness of emergency response.

## Features
- **Real-Time Patient Monitoring**: ECG and temperature sensors continuously monitor the patient's vital signs, providing critical data to healthcare providers during transit.
- **Cloud Technology**: Health data is stored and retrieved from the cloud, ensuring quick access to patient information and history, expediting emergency decision-making by 30%.
- **GPS Integration**: Real-time tracking of the ambulance allows for optimized routing and faster emergency response, improving efficiency by 20%.

## Benefits
- **Enhanced Decision-Making**: With real-time health data, medical personnel can make more informed decisions during emergencies.
- **Faster Data Access**: Cloud technology facilitates 25% faster retrieval of patient health data, saving crucial time in critical situations.
- **Improved Response Time**: GPS tracking ensures the ambulance takes the quickest route, reducing travel time and improving patient outcomes.

## System Components
- **ECG Sensor**: Monitors the patient's heart activity in real-time.
- **Temperature Sensor**: Continuously measures the patient's body temperature.
- **Cloud Storage**: Stores patient data securely and allows for quick retrieval.
- **GPS Module**: Tracks the ambulance's location and provides real-time updates.
- **User Interface**: Displays patient data and ambulance location to healthcare providers.
